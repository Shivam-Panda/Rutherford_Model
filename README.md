# Project Description

The goal of this project is to show the Rutherford's experiments with both Thomson's model and Rutherford's model, and show how it is evident that Rutherford's model is the only model that could explain the large angle deflections of alpha particles when shot into the gold foil

# Project Tools
- Python along with Pygame will be used for the entire applications

# Background Information

## Thomson's Model

In an atom, the positive charge is evenly distributed across the the volume of the atom.

## What is Rutherford's Experiment?

Rutherford's experiment was to experimentally validate Thomson's model, only to contradict it. Essentially, Rutherford shot alpha particles at a certain velocity into a thin gold foil, on the order of (10^-6 m), containing (10^4 Gold Atoms), and since the alpha particle and the gold strip were both positively charged, the alpha particle would be repelled by the atoms. Rutherford measured the angle of deflection of the alpha particle, and with Thomson's model, the expected deflections were incredibly small, on the order of 0.01 degrees, and the probability of a large angle deflection was on the order of 10^-30, however Rutherford found the probability of large angle deflection to be on the order of 10^-4.

## Rutherford's Model

Rutherford explained the relatively probable large angle deflections by introducing a nucleus, where all of the positive charge of the atom was stored, and therefore, if the alpha particle was sufficiently close to the nucleus, the alpha particle would experience large angle deflections, explaining the probable large angle deflections.
